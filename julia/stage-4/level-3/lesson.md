## Stage 4: Full Problem Solving

### Today's Mission

Now you're building real applications! This stage combines everything you've learned to create complete, working programs that solve real-world problems.

**The Process:**
1. Analyze the application requirements
2. Design the architecture and data flow
3. Implement features one by one
4. Test thoroughly with various inputs
5. Refine and optimize the solution

---

### Learning Goals

- Build complete, working applications
- Integrate multiple programming concepts
- Handle real-world requirements
- Practice debugging and testing
- Create user-friendly interfaces

---

### Your Task

**Application Requirements:**

Build a complete Data Processing application that:
- Meets all functional requirements
- Handles errors gracefully
- Provides clear user feedback
- Works with various inputs
- Is well-organized and commented

**Application Specifications:**
- Use Julia best practices
- Implement proper input validation
- Add helpful error messages
- Test with real-world scenarios
- Document your code clearly

---


### How to Run

1. **Run the code**:
   ```bash
   julia hello.jl
   ```

**Expected output:**
```julia
Hello, World!
```julia

### How to Approach This

**Step 1: Understand**
- Read all requirements carefully
- Identify inputs, outputs, and constraints
- Ask yourself: "What is the core problem?"

**Step 2: Plan**
- Sketch out your approach on paper
- List the steps needed
- Identify potential challenges

**Step 3: Implement**
- Start with a basic version
- Add features incrementally
- Test after each addition

**Step 4: Test**
- Try normal cases
- Try edge cases (empty, max, min)
- Try invalid inputs
- Verify all requirements met

**Step 5: Refine**
- Review your code
- Add comments
- Optimize if needed
- Ensure it's readable

### Key Concepts

**Application Design:**
- Modular code is easier to debug
- User experience matters
- Error handling is not optional
- Test early and often

**Best Practices:**
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- Meaningful variable names
- Comments for complex logic

---

### Try This (Optional Challenges)

1. Extend the solution with additional features
2. Handle more edge cases
3. Optimize for performance
4. Add a user interface
5. Write unit tests

---

### Helpful Resources

- Review previous lessons for syntax help
- Check WORKSPACE_INSTRUCTIONS.md for setup
- Use `<Space>h` in Vim for keyboard shortcuts
- Test frequently to catch errors early

## ANSWER KEY (Study after attempting!)

### Solution Approach

**Application Architecture:**

A complete application has these components:

1. **Input Layer**: Get data from user/file/API
2. **Validation Layer**: Check data is valid
3. **Processing Layer**: Core business logic
4. **Output Layer**: Display/save results
5. **Error Handling**: Manage problems gracefully

**Code Organization:**
```julia
// Setup and initialization
// Main program loop or flow
// Helper functions
// Error handlers
// Testing/verification
```julia

Build incrementally - get one feature working before adding the next.

### Common Errors & Solutions

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Logic error | Algorithm design flaw | Review pseudocode, trace by hand |
| Syntax error | Language rules violated | Check language documentation |
| Runtime error | Invalid operation | Add validation, handle edge cases |
| Wrong output | Misunderstanding requirements | Re-read problem carefully |

### Next Steps

1. Review your solution critically
2. Compare with best practices
3. Optimize if needed
4. Move to next level when ready
5. Keep practicing!
