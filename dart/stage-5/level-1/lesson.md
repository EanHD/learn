## Stage 5: Capstone Projects

### Today's Mission

Welcome to Stage 5 - Capstone Projects! You've learned the fundamentals of Dart programming. Now it's time to build something real and meaningful. This capstone project will demonstrate your skills to yourself and others.

### Learning Goals

- Apply all Dart skills in a real project
- Practice professional development workflow
- Create a portfolio-worthy project
- Learn project planning and management

### Your Task

You're going to build a complete Dart application. This is a real project that combines:

- User interface (input/output)
- Data processing
- Logic and decision-making
- Error handling
- Code organization


### How to Run

1. **Run the code**:
   ```bash
   dart hello.dart
   ```dart

**Expected output:**
```dart
Hello, World!
```dart

### Project Requirements

A complete Dart project must include:

1. **Functionality** - Does it actually do something useful?
2. **User Experience** - Is it easy to use?
3. **Code Quality** - Is the code clean and organized?
4. **Documentation** - Can someone understand what your code does?
5. **Testing** - Does it handle different inputs correctly?

### Your Development Process

**Week 1: Planning**
- Define what your program will do
- Sketch the user interface
- List all features

**Week 2: Design**
- Write pseudocode for major features
- Plan how data flows through the program
- Identify potential challenges

**Week 3: Implementation**
- Write the Dart code
- Test as you go
- Fix bugs immediately

**Week 4: Polish**
- Add error handling
- Improve user experience
- Add comments and documentation

### Project Ideas

- **Calculator**: Advanced calculator with multiple operations
- **Data Analysis Tool**: Process and analyze data
- **Game**: Simple interactive game
- **Utilities**: Useful tool for everyday tasks
- **Educational Tool**: Teaching something with code

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Project is complete and functional
- [ ] Code is well-organized and commented
- [ ] User can understand how to use it
- [ ] Handles errors gracefully
- [ ] You can explain every part of the code

### What's Next After Capstone?

You've now learned the fundamentals! What comes next:

1. **Explore Libraries** - Use Dart's built-in and third-party libraries
2. **Learn Best Practices** - Professional coding standards
3. **Build More Projects** - Each project teaches you something new
4. **Specialize** - Choose what to build with Dart

### Celebration Point

If you've reached here and completed projects in Stage 5, you're a programmer. Not "learning to program" - you **are** a programmer. Congratulations!

## Answer Key

### Complete Solution

```dart
void main() {
    print("Hello, World!");
}

```dart

### Code Breakdown

This solution demonstrates the key concepts from this lesson:

1. **Structure**: The program follows standard dart conventions with proper imports and main function
2. **Variables**: Data types are correctly declared and initialized
3. **Logic**: The program implements the required functionality
4. **Output**: Results are displayed clearly to the user
5. **Best Practices**: Code is readable and follows naming conventions

### Testing Your Solution

Try these test cases to verify your code works correctly:

1. **Basic Test**: Run the program with standard inputs
2. **Edge Cases**: Test with boundary values (0, -1, very large numbers)
3. **Error Handling**: Verify the program handles invalid inputs gracefully

### Tips for Understanding

- Review each section carefully
- Try modifying values to see how output changes
- Add your own printf/print statements to trace execution
- Experiment with different inputs
