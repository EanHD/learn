## Stage 1: Copying Code

### Today's Mission

Now that you know how to run Dart programs, let's learn about variables! Variables are like containers that store information. Dart makes it easy to work with different data types.

### Learning Goals

- Understand what variables are and why they're useful
- Learn about Dart's data types
- Practice storing and displaying different types of data
- See how variables make code reusable

### Your Task

Copy the following code EXACTLY as shown into a new file called `variables.dart`:

```dart
void main() {
  String name = "Alice";
  int age = 25;
  double height = 5.6;
  bool isStudent = true;

  print("Hello, $name!");
  print("You are $age years old.");
  print("Your height is $height feet.");
  print("Student status: $isStudent");
}
```

### How to Execute

```bash
dart variables.dart
```

Expected output:

```
Hello, Alice!
You are 25 years old.
Your height is 5.6 feet.
Student status: true
```

### Success Checklist

- [ ] Created a file named `variables.dart`
- [ ] Copied the code exactly as shown
- [ ] Ran the program successfully
- [ ] Saw all four lines of output with the stored values

### What Happened?

You just used variables to store and display different types of information! Here's what each part does:

- String variables store text values
- Integer variables store whole numbers
- Float/Double variables store decimal numbers
- Boolean variables store true/false values

### Try This (Optional Challenges)

1. Change the name, age, height, and student status to your own information
2. Add a new variable for your favorite color and display it
3. Try changing a variable's value and see how the output changes
