# Level 6: Loops

> **📖 LESSON NOTE:** This lesson file is **read-only** to prevent accidental edits. Your code goes in the **right window** (\`main.cpp\` or similar). The lesson stays on the **left** for reference. Press \`Ctrl+l\` to switch to your code window, or \`<Space>h\` for help.


## Stage 1: Copying Code

### Today's Mission

Now that you've learned the basics, let's explore repeating code with loops! This fundamental concept is used in almost every program you'll write.

### Learning Goals

- Understand how to use loops in Dart
- Learn the syntax specific to Dart
- Practice implementing loops
- See real-world use cases

### Your Task

We'll focus on understanding how loops works in Dart. For now, copy the provided code and run it to see the results. Don't worry if you don't understand every detail yet - that comes with practice!

### Important Note

At this stage, we focus on copying and understanding. You'll start writing your own code in Stage 2 (Pseudocode to Code).

### How to Execute

```bash
dart program.dart
```

### Success Checklist

- [ ] Created the file
- [ ] Copied the code exactly as shown
- [ ] Program executed without errors
- [ ] Understood what the output represents

### What's Next?

In Stage 2, you'll take what you learned here and start translating logic into code. The progression is:

1. **Stage 1 (Copying)** - Get familiar with syntax
2. **Stage 2 (Pseudocode→Code)** - Translate plain English to code
3. **Stage 3 (Problem→Pseudocode)** - Write the logic first
4. **Stage 4 (Full Problem Solving)** - Complete independence
5. **Stage 5 (Capstone)** - Real-world projects

### Code Breakdown

> **NEEDS_AUTHOR:** This lesson needs a complete answer key with code breakdown, execution process explanation, common errors table, and bonus knowledge section. Reference c-c++/stage-1/level-1/lesson.md for the gold standard format.

### Key Concepts

- Review the code structure specific to Dart
- Understand the execution flow
- Learn common pitfalls and solutions

### Next Steps

Practice the code and experiment with variations!
