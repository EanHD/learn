## Stage 2: Pseudocode to Code

### Today's Mission

You're progressing! Now you'll take more complex pseudocode and translate it into Dart code. This level focuses on writing and calling functions.

### Learning Goals

- Translate pseudocode involving writing and calling functions
- Understand how different programming constructs work
- Practice problem decomposition
- Build your Dart vocabulary

### Your Task

Here's some pseudocode:

```dart
[Pseudocode will be specific to the level]
```dart

**Your mission**: Translate this into Dart code in `main.dart.dart`.

### How to Run

```bash
cd ~/.local/share/learn/workspaces/dart/stage-2/level-7
```dart

Then run your program.

**Expected output:**
```dart
(Output will vary based on your implementation)
```dart

### Success Checklist

- [ ] Translated all pseudocode statements
- [ ] Program runs without errors
- [ ] Output matches expected output
- [ ] Code is clean and readable

### Hints for Success

1. Read the pseudocode carefully - understand what it's trying to do
2. Break it down into smaller steps
3. Implement each step in Dart, one at a time
4. Test as you go

### What's Next?

Each level in Stage 2 builds on the previous one. You're learning to think like a programmer!

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Answer Key

### Complete Solution

```dart
void main() {
    print("Hello, World!");
}

```dart

### Code Breakdown

This solution demonstrates the key concepts from this lesson:

1. **Structure**: The program follows standard dart conventions with proper imports and main function
2. **Variables**: Data types are correctly declared and initialized
3. **Logic**: The program implements the required functionality
4. **Output**: Results are displayed clearly to the user
5. **Best Practices**: Code is readable and follows naming conventions

### Testing Your Solution

Try these test cases to verify your code works correctly:

1. **Basic Test**: Run the program with standard inputs
2. **Edge Cases**: Test with boundary values (0, -1, very large numbers)
3. **Error Handling**: Verify the program handles invalid inputs gracefully

### Tips for Understanding

- Review each section carefully
- Try modifying values to see how output changes
- Add your own printf/print statements to trace execution
- Experiment with different inputs
