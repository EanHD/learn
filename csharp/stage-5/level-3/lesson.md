### Project Scope

This level requires:

- Complete feature implementation
- Proper error handling
- User-friendly interface
- Well-organized code
- Comprehensive testing

### Your Task

Design and implement a Csharp project that demonstrates your mastery of the language.

### Project Suggestions

- Build something that interests you
- Solve a real problem
- Create something you'd use
- Make it complex enough to be interesting
- Keep it focused in scope

### Development Checklist

- [ ] Clear project goal defined
