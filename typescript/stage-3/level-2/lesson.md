## Stage 3: Problem to Pseudocode

### Today's Mission

Another level, another challenge! You're getting stronger at analyzing problems. This level focuses on working with variables.

### Learning Goals

- Analyze a problem involving working with variables
- Write clear pseudocode
- Understand the problem before coding
- Think before you type

### Your Task

Read the problem carefully:

```
[Problem statement will be specific to this level]
```

**Step 1:** Write pseudocode in `pseudocode.txt` that solves this problem

**Step 2:** Implement your pseudocode in Typescript

Create `main.typescript.typescript` with your solution.

### Success Checklist

- [ ] Understand the problem completely
- [ ] Wrote clear, logical pseudocode
- [ ] Translated to working Typescript code
- [ ] All requirements are met

### The Problem-Solving Process

1. **Read** - What are we trying to accomplish?
2. **Think** - What steps do we need?
3. **Design** - Write pseudocode
4. **Code** - Implement in Typescript
5. **Test** - Does it work?

Each iteration of this cycle makes you a better programmer!
