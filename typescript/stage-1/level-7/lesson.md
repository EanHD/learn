# Level 7: Functions
## Stage 1: Copying Code

### Today's Mission

Now that you've learned the basics, let's explore writing reusable code with functions! This fundamental concept is used in almost every program you'll write.

### Learning Goals

- Understand how to use functions in Typescript
- Learn the syntax specific to Typescript
- Practice implementing functions
- See real-world use cases

### Your Task

We'll focus on understanding how functions works in Typescript. For now, copy the provided code and run it to see the results. Don't worry if you don't understand every detail yet - that comes with practice!

### Important Note

At this stage, we focus on copying and understanding. You'll start writing your own code in Stage 2 (Pseudocode to Code).

### How to Execute

```bash
ts-node program.ts
```

### Success Checklist

- [ ] Created the file
- [ ] Copied the code exactly as shown
- [ ] Program executed without errors
- [ ] Understood what the output represents

### What's Next?

In Stage 2, you'll take what you learned here and start translating logic into code. The progression is:

1. **Stage 1 (Copying)** - Get familiar with syntax
2. **Stage 2 (Pseudocode→Code)** - Translate plain English to code
3. **Stage 3 (Problem→Pseudocode)** - Write the logic first
4. **Stage 4 (Full Problem Solving)** - Complete independence
5. **Stage 5 (Capstone)** - Real-world projects
