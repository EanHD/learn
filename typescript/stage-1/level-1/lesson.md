## Stage 1: Copying Code

### Today's Mission

Welcome to TypeScript! Today, you'll create your first TypeScript program. TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, making it easier to catch errors and build large-scale applications.

### Learning Goals

- Understand TypeScript program structure
- Learn how to run TypeScript code
- Create your first output
- Get comfortable with TypeScript syntax

### Your Task

Copy the following code EXACTLY as shown into a new file called `hello.ts`:

```typescript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

### How to Execute

```bash
ts-node hello.ts
```

Expected output:

```typescript
Hello, World!
```

### Success Checklist

- [ ] Created a file named `hello.ts`
- [ ] Copied the code exactly as shown
- [ ] Program executed without errors
- [ ] Saw "Hello, World!" printed
