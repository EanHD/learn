## Stage 1: Copying Code

### Today's Mission

Welcome to TypeScript! Today, you'll create your first TypeScript program. TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, making it easier to catch errors and build large-scale applications.

### Learning Goals

- Understand TypeScript program structure
- Learn how to run TypeScript code
- Create your first output
- Get comfortable with TypeScript syntax

### Your Task

Copy the following code EXACTLY as shown into a new file called `hello.ts`:

```typescript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```type

### How to Execute

```bash
ts-node hello.ts
```type

Expected output:

```typescript
Hello, World!
```type

### Success Checklist

- [ ] Created a file named `hello.ts`
- [ ] Copied the code exactly as shown
- [ ] Program executed without errors
- [ ] Saw "Hello, World!" printed

**TypeScript is JavaScript with superpowers - static types for safer, more maintainable code!**

- Helper functions: Support logic


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Answer Key

### Complete Solution

```ts
console.log("Hello, World!");

```ts

### Code Breakdown

This solution demonstrates the key concepts from this lesson:

1. **Structure**: The program follows standard typescript conventions with proper imports and main function
2. **Variables**: Data types are correctly declared and initialized
3. **Logic**: The program implements the required functionality
4. **Output**: Results are displayed clearly to the user
5. **Best Practices**: Code is readable and follows naming conventions

### Testing Your Solution

Try these test cases to verify your code works correctly:

1. **Basic Test**: Run the program with standard inputs
2. **Edge Cases**: Test with boundary values (0, -1, very large numbers)
3. **Error Handling**: Verify the program handles invalid inputs gracefully

### Tips for Understanding

- Review each section carefully
- Try modifying values to see how output changes
- Add your own printf/print statements to trace execution
- Experiment with different inputs
