## Stage 2: Pseudocode to Code

### Today's Mission

Now that you know the basics, it's time to think like a programmer! You'll take pseudocode (plain English instructions) and translate it into real Shell code. This is where programming logic comes to life.

### Learning Goals

- Understand how pseudocode maps to real code
- Learn to translate plain English into Shell syntax
- Practice reading and implementing logic from specifications
- Build confidence in independent coding

### Your Task

Here's some pseudocode that describes a simple program:

```bash
START
    print "Welcome to the program!"
    print "This is my first real program"
    print "I'm learning to code!"
END
```

**Your mission**: Translate this pseudocode into Shell code and save it as `main.sh`.

Hints:

- Each `print` instruction becomes the appropriate output statement in Shell
- Text to print goes inside quotation marks
- Each statement should be on its own line

### How to Run

```bash
cd ~/.local/share/learn/workspaces/shell/stage-2/level-1
bash main.sh
```

Expected output:

```bash
Welcome to the program!
This is my first real program
I'm learning to code!
```

### Success Checklist

- [ ] Created three output statements
- [ ] Each output statement has the correct message
- [ ] Program runs without errors
- [ ] Output matches expected output exactly
- [ ] All text is in quotation marks

### Hint: Answer Key

If you're stuck, here's what your code should look like (don't peek until you try!):

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## ANSWER KEY

```sh
```

(Fill in based on language-specific syntax)

```bash

## What's Different About Stage 2?

**Stage 1 (Copying):** Code was provided, you typed it
**Stage 2 (Pseudocode→Code):** Logic is provided, you write the code

This is a crucial step! You're now writing code from specifications, not just copying. This is how real programming works.

### Key Concepts

- Pseudocode is language-independent - the same pseudocode could translate to many languages
- Your job is to understand the logic and implement it correctly
- Different languages have different syntax, but the logic is the same
