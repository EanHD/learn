## Stage 2: Pseudocode to Code

### Today's Mission

You're progressing! Now you'll take more complex pseudocode and translate it into Shell code. This level focuses on using loops for repetition.

### Learning Goals

- Translate pseudocode involving using loops for repetition
- Understand how different programming constructs work
- Practice problem decomposition
- Build your Shell vocabulary

### Your Task

Here's some pseudocode:

```
[Pseudocode will be specific to the level]
```

**Your mission**: Translate this into Shell code in `main.shell.shell`.

### How to Run

```bash
cd ~/.local/share/learn/workspaces/shell/stage-2/level-6
```

Then run your program.

### Success Checklist

- [ ] Translated all pseudocode statements
- [ ] Program runs without errors
- [ ] Output matches expected output
- [ ] Code is clean and readable

### Hints for Success

1. Read the pseudocode carefully - understand what it's trying to do
2. Break it down into smaller steps
3. Implement each step in Shell, one at a time
4. Test as you go

### What's Next?

Each level in Stage 2 builds on the previous one. You're learning to think like a programmer!
