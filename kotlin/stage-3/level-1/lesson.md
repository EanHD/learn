## Stage 3: Problem to Pseudocode

### Today's Mission

You're now ready for Stage 3! This is where you start thinking like a real programmer. Instead of being given pseudocode, you'll read a problem description and write the pseudocode yourself. Then you'll implement it in Kotlin.

### Learning Goals

- Learn to read a problem and understand what's being asked
- Practice writing pseudocode from problem descriptions
- Understand the design phase of programming
- Build confidence in problem analysis

### Your Task

**Problem:** Write a program that greets the user with their name.

Step 1: Write the pseudocode first

```kotlin
What should happen:
1. Print "Hello, [name]"

Write your pseudocode in plain English below:
(Your pseudocode here)
```

Step 2: Implement your pseudocode in Kotlin

Create `main.kotlin.kotlin` with your solution.


### How to Compile and Run

1. **Compile the code**:
   ```bash
   kotlinc hello.kt
   ```

2. **Run your program**:
   ```bash
   kotlin hello
   ```

**Expected output:**
```
Hello, World!
```

### Success Checklist

- [ ] Wrote pseudocode that describes the solution
- [ ] Pseudocode is clear and logical
- [ ] Translated pseudocode to Kotlin code
- [ ] Program runs without errors
- [ ] Output matches expected result

### The Design Phase

Professional programmers spend time planning before coding:

1. **Understand** - Read the problem carefully
2. **Plan** - Write pseudocode to outline the solution
3. **Implement** - Write the actual code
4. **Test** - Make sure it works correctly

You're now learning this professional workflow!

### What This Teaches

- Not all problems come with detailed instructions
- You need to think about solutions before coding
- Design is as important as implementation
- Clear thinking leads to clear code
