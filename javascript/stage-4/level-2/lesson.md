## Stage 4: Full Problem Solving

### Your Challenge

Build a game where:

1. Computer picks random number 1-100
2. Player guesses until correct
3. Shows if guess is too high/low
4. Counts and displays attempts

## ANSWER KEY

```javascript
let secret = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;
let attempts = 0;

console.log("I'm thinking of a number 1-100");

let guesses = [45, 72, 88, 92, 95, 97, 98, 99];
for (let i = 0; i < guesses.length; i++) {
    let guess = guesses[i];
    attempts++;
    console.log("Guess: " + guess);
    if (guess === secret) {
        console.log("Correct! Got it in " + attempts + " attempts");
        break;
    } else if (guess < secret) {
        console.log("Too low");
    } else {
        console.log("Too high");
    }
}
```
