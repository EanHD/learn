## Stage 3: Problem to Pseudocode

### Your Problem

Write a calculator that performs basic operations on two numbers.

Example output:

```
10 + 5 = 15
10 - 5 = 5
10 * 5 = 50
10 / 5 = 2
```

## ANSWER KEY

```javascript
let num1 = 10;
let num2 = 5;

console.log(num1 + " + " + num2 + " = " + (num1 + num2));
console.log(num1 + " - " + num2 + " = " + (num1 - num2));
console.log(num1 + " * " + num2 + " = " + (num1 * num2));
console.log(num1 + " / " + num2 + " = " + (num1 / num2));
```
