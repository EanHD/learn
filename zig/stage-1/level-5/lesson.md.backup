# Level 5: Conditional Statements

> **📖 LESSON NOTE:** This lesson file is **read-only** to prevent accidental edits. Your code goes in the **right window** (`main.zig` or similar). The lesson stays on the **left** for reference. Press `Ctrl+l` to switch to your code window, or `<Space>h` for help.

## Stage 1: Copying Code

### Today's Mission

Add decision-making to your programs with if/else statements.

---

### Learning Goals

- Understand conditional logic and boolean expressions
- Master if, else if, and else statements
- Practice with comparison and logical operators
- Create programs that make intelligent decisions

---

### Your Task

**Copy the following code EXACTLY as shown below into `main.zig`**

```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
    const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();
    const stdin = std.io.getStdIn().reader();
    
    try stdout.print("Enter your score (0-100): ", .{});
    
    var buf: [10]u8 = undefined;
    const input = try stdin.readUntilDelimiter(&buf, '\n');
    const score = try std.fmt.parseInt(i32, input, 10);
    
    if (score >= 90) {
        try stdout.print("Grade: A - Excellent!\n", .{});
    } else if (score >= 80) {
        try stdout.print("Grade: B - Good job!\n", .{});
    } else if (score >= 70) {
        try stdout.print("Grade: C - Passing\n", .{});
    } else if (score >= 60) {
        try stdout.print("Grade: D - Needs improvement\n", .{});
    } else {
        try stdout.print("Grade: F - Study harder!\n", .{});
    }
}
```

---

### How to Run

**Method 1 (Vim - Recommended):**
```
<Space>r
```

**Method 2 (Terminal):**
```bash
zig build-exe main.zig
./main
```

**Expected output:**
```
Hello, World!
```

(Your actual output will vary based on the code example)

### Success Checklist

- [ ] Created a file named `main.zig`
- [ ] Copied the code exactly as shown
- [ ] Compiled without errors
- [ ] Ran the program successfully
- [ ] Understood the basic concepts
- [ ] Experimented with small modifications

---

### What Just Happened?

You just created a real Zig program! Here's what makes it work:

- Conditional statements let programs make decisions
- Comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=) test relationships
- Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) combine conditions
- Programs can respond differently based on conditions

---

### Try This (Optional Challenges)

1. Modify the values and see what changes
2. Add your own variations to the code
3. Combine concepts from previous lessons
4. Break something on purpose, then fix it!

---

### Pro Tips

- Zig has no hidden control flow
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Compile-time code execution

## ANSWER KEY (No peeking until you've tried!)

### Code Breakdown

The code you copied demonstrates fundamental Zig concepts:

**Key Components:**
- Syntax rules specific to Zig
- How data is stored and manipulated
- Input/output operations
- Program flow and structure

### Common Errors & Solutions

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Syntax error | Typo in code | Double-check spelling and punctuation |
| Runtime error | Code runs but crashes | Check your logic and data types |
| Unexpected output | Logic error | Review your algorithm step-by-step |
| Compilation error | Code won't compile | Fix syntax before running |

### Bonus Knowledge

- Zig has a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools
- Understanding these basics prepares you for advanced topics
- Practice is key - try writing similar programs from scratch
- Every expert programmer started exactly where you are now!

### Real-World Applications

This concept is used in:
1. Professional software development
2. Web applications and mobile apps
3. Data analysis and scientific computing
4. Automation and scripting
5. Game development
