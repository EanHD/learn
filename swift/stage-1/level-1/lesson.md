## Stage 1: Copying Code

### Today's Mission

Welcome to Swift! Today, you'll create your first Swift program. Swift is Apple's modern programming language used for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS development.

### Learning Goals

- Understand Swift program structure
- Learn how to run Swift code
- Create your first output
- Get comfortable with Swift syntax

### Your Task

Copy the following code EXACTLY as shown into a new file called `hello.swift`:

```swift
print("Hello, World!")
```

### How to Execute

```bash
swift hello.swift
```

Expected output:
