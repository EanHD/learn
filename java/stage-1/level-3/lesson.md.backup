# Level 3: Basic Math Operations

> **📖 LESSON NOTE:** This lesson file is **read-only**. Your code goes in the **right window** (`main.java`).

## Stage 1: Copying Code

### Today's Mission

Learn how to perform **mathematical operations** in Java. Math is everywhere in programming!

---

### Learning Goals

- Perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %)
- Understand operator precedence
- Work with integers and decimals
- Print calculation results

---

### Your Task

**Copy the following code EXACTLY into `main.java`**

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 10;
        int y = 5;

        System.out.println("Addition: " + (x + y));
        System.out.println("Subtraction: " + (x - y));
        System.out.println("Multiplication: " + (x * y));
        System.out.println("Division: " + (x / y));
        System.out.println("Modulo (remainder): " + (x % y));
    }
}
```

---

### How to Run

**Vim:** `<Space>r`

**Terminal:**
```bash
javac main.java
java Main
```

**Expected output:**
```
Addition: 15
Subtraction: 5
Multiplication: 50
Division: 2
Modulo (remainder): 0
```

---

### Success Checklist

- [ ] Copied all the code to `main.java`
- [ ] Compiled with `javac main.java`
- [ ] Ran with `java Main`
- [ ] All output matches exactly

---

### What Happened?

Java supports five basic arithmetic operators:

- **`+`** - Addition
- **`-`** - Subtraction
- **`*`** - Multiplication
- **`/`** - Division (result is whole number for integers)
- **`%`** - Modulo (gives remainder)

The parentheses `(x + y)` ensure the calculation happens before printing!

---

### Try This (Optional Challenges)

1. Change x and y to different numbers
2. Try calculating: (x + y) * 2
3. What happens if you divide by a smaller number?

## ANSWER KEY

### Code Breakdown

```java
int x = 10;
int y = 5;
System.out.println("Addition: " + (x + y));  // 10 + 5 = 15
```

The `(x + y)` happens first (operator precedence), then concatenates with the string.

### Arithmetic Operators in Java

| Operator | Purpose | Example | Result |
|----------|---------|---------|--------|
| `+` | Addition | `10 + 5` | `15` |
| `-` | Subtraction | `10 - 5` | `5` |
| `*` | Multiplication | `10 * 5` | `50` |
| `/` | Division | `10 / 5` | `2` |
| `%` | Modulo (remainder) | `10 % 3` | `1` |

### Integer vs Floating Point Division

```java
int a = 10 / 3;      // Result: 3 (not 3.33)
double b = 10.0 / 3; // Result: 3.333...
```

Integer division truncates (cuts off) decimals!

### Common Errors & Solutions

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `error: operator cannot be applied` | Wrong types | Use compatible types like `int + int` |
| Unexpected result (like 3 instead of 3.33) | Integer division | Use `double` instead of `int` |

### Bonus Knowledge

- **Operator Precedence**: `*` and `/` happen before `+` and `-`
- **Modulo Operator**: Useful for checking if numbers are even/odd, cycling through values
