## ⚠️ What Needs One Fix

**Stage 4 Problem:**
- Currently: "Build this application"
- Should be: "Design YOUR application"

**Why it matters:**
- Stages 1-3 teach students to CREATE solutions
- Stage 4 asks them to IMPLEMENT specifications
- This breaks the learning progression

**Effort to fix:** 3-5 hours  
**Impact:** Huge (turns good curriculum into world-class)

---

## 📋 The One Thing to Do

Rewrite 7 lesson files to ask students:
1. "Create your problem statement"
2. "Design your solution"  
3. "Write pseudocode"
4. "Implement in C"
5. "Test thoroughly"

Instead of:
> "Implement this Grade Manager with these specs..."

**Result:** Students become independent programmers with portfolio projects

---

## 📊 What Students Experience

**Current:**
- Stages 1-3: "I can analyze problems and design solutions!"
- Stage 4: "Wait... now I'm just implementing specs?"
- **Confused** ❌

**After fix:**
- Stages 1-3: "I can analyze problems and design solutions!"
- Stage 4: "Now I create and implement my own solutions!"
- **Confident** ✅
