## Weekly Schedule Example

### Week 1: Stage 1 Foundation

```
Day 1: Level 1 (read and understand)
Day 2: Level 2 (patterns emerge)
Day 3: Level 3 (comprehension deepens)
Day 4: Level 4 (combine concepts)
Day 5: Level 5 (more complex code)
Day 6: Level 6 (real program structures)
Day 7: Level 7 (capstone of stage 1)
```

### Week 2: Stage 2 Application

```
Day 8-9:   Levels 1-2 (simple translation)
Day 10-11: Levels 3-4 (conditionals and logic)
Day 12-13: Levels 5-6 (loops and functions)
Day 14:    Level 7 (comprehensive project)
```

### Weeks 3-5: Stages 3-4 Mastery

Progressive problem solving without guidance

### Weeks 6-10: Stage 5 Projects

Deep, meaningful projects that demonstrate mastery

---

## Dual Language Progression

You can follow three approaches:

### Approach A: Sequential (C++ then Rust)

```
Week 1-5:  Complete C++ Stages 1-5 (35 lessons)
Week 6-10: Complete Rust Stages 1-5 (35 lessons)
```

**Advantage**: Deep mastery in one language, then apply to another
**Time**: 10 weeks total

### Approach B: Parallel (Same Stage, Both Languages)

```
Week 1: C++ Stage 1 + Rust Stage 1
Week 2: C++ Stage 2 + Rust Stage 2
Week 3: C++ Stage 3 + Rust Stage 3
Week 4: C++ Stage 4 + Rust Stage 4
Week 5: C++ Stage 5 + Rust Stage 5
```

**Advantage**: Compare languages, reinforce concepts
**Time**: 5 weeks total

### Approach C: Hybrid (Mix as Desired)

```bash
learn c++ 1 --stage 1
learn c++ 2 --stage 1
learn rust 1 --stage 1    # Switch to Rust
learn rust 2 --stage 1
learn c++ 3 --stage 2     # Jump to C++ Stage 2
# ... continue as desired
```

**Advantage**: Maximum flexibility, learn at your pace

After completing all 35 lessons in a language:

1. **Review favorites** - Revisit interesting lessons
2. **Create advanced projects** - Combine multiple concepts
3. **Contribute to open source** - Apply skills in real projects
4. **Teach others** - Write your own lessons
5. **Explore specializations** - Web, systems, games, etc.

## Motivation & Mindset

### Remember

- **Each lesson builds on previous**: Don't skip stages
- **Struggle is learning**: Hard problems mean growth
- **Progress is not linear**: Some days are harder
- **Vim skills compound**: Each session makes you faster
- **You're building a foundation**: This is a long-term investment

### When Stuck

1. Go back to previous lessons to review
2. Search the lesson for related concepts
3. Take a break and return refreshed
4. Start with a simpler version of the problem
5. Read the FAQ and guides

### Celebrate Progress

```bash
learn --info   # See your total sessions
# You've completed X lessons!
```
