# VIM MODE: Learn Programming in Neovim

Welcome to **VIM MODE**, a professional learning experience designed for developers who want to master programming AND master Vim simultaneously.

> **Why Vim?** Because the skills you learn in Vim will stay with you forever, across every system, every codebase, and every decade of your career.

---

## What is VIM MODE?

VIM MODE teaches you to learn lessons and code simultaneously in Neovim:

```
NEOVIM (Your Learning Environment)


 Lesson Text               Code Editor
 (Read-only)              (Your coding)

 - Navigation              - Live editing
 - Concepts                - Testing
 - Guidelines              - Compilation

 (Vim Keys)                (Vim Keys)


 Terminal Output (Compilation/Results)
```

### Core Workflow

1. **Read** the lesson (left buffer)
2. **Code** your solution (right buffer)
3. **Compile** from the terminal (bottom)
4. **Learn** Vim keybindings naturally through use

---

## Quick Start (2 minutes)

### For the Impatient

```bash
# Navigate to LEARN directory
cd ~/LEARN

# List all lessons
learn --list

# Open your first lesson (C++, Level 1)
learn c++ 1

# Immediately you'll see:
# - Left pane: lesson content (what to learn)
# - Right pane: code editor (where to write)
```

### Inside Neovim

```vim
gg                      Jump to top of lesson
G                       Jump to bottom
/Learning Goals         Search for concepts
n                       Find next match

C-l                     Move to code pane
i                       Start typing your code
:w                      Save when done

:terminal               Open terminal for testing
gcc solution.c -o solution && ./solution
exit                    Return to editor

:call NextLesson()      Jump to next level
```

---

## Navigation

### Using the CLI

```bash
learn c++ 1             Open C++ Level 1
learn rust 2            Open Rust Level 2
learn c++ 1 --stage 3   Jump to Stage 3, Level 1
learn --list            List all lessons
learn --info            Show your progress
learn --next            Get next lesson suggestion
```

### Inside Vim

```vim
<leader>n               Next lesson
<leader>p               Previous lesson
<leader>i               Show current lesson info
<leader>?               Show all commands

C-h / C-l               Left/right windows
C-j / C-k               Down/up windows
```

---

## The Five Learning Stages

Each stage has 7 progressive lessons (35 lessons per language).

**Stage 1: Copying Code** - Learn by copying and understanding existing code

**Stage 2: Pseudocode to Code** - Translate English-like instructions into programs

**Stage 3: Problem to Pseudocode** - Analyze problems and write your own solutions

**Stage 4: Full Problem Solving** - Complete independence with real-world problems

**Stage 5: Capstone Projects** - Build professional-quality applications for your portfolio

Welcome to VIM MODE. Happy learning!


 Buffers (C-^, :bn, :bp)
 Windows (:split, :vsplit, C-w)
 Macros (q, @)

↓ Apply to Programming

Stage 1: Syntax
 Use marks to jump between concepts
 Macros to generate templates
 Buffers to view code + output

Stage 2: Logic
 Visual mode for pseudocode
 Registers to track ideas
 Search to understand patterns

... and so on
```

## Your Typical Learning Session

```vim
# Start a session
$ nvim

# Step 1: Open lesson in left buffer
:vsplit ../../c-c++/stage-1/level-1/lesson.md
:set readonly " Don't accidentally edit the lesson

# Step 2: Open code template in right buffer
:e solution.c
:r TEMPLATES/code-template.c " Insert boilerplate

# Step 3: Navigate and code
" Use Vim movements to jump between lesson concepts
gg " Go to top of lesson
/Learning Goals " Search for section
} " Jump to next section
ma " Mark important concept

" Switch to right buffer
C-w l " Focus right window
" ... write your code ...

# Step 4: Compile and test
:terminal
gcc solution.c -o solution && ./solution

# Step 5: Mark completion
" Switch back to lesson buffer
C-w h
:call LessonMarkComplete() " Custom function (in config)
```

## Why This Works

### Immersive Learning
- Lesson and code visible simultaneously
- No alt-tabbing, no distraction
- Muscle memory for Vim grows naturally

### Efficient Workflow
- All in one terminal
- Keyboard-driven (faster than mouse)
- Persistent sessions (save your work)

### Deep Vim Skills
- Learn by doing, not by reading about Vim
- Practical macros solve real problems
- Custom keybindings become habits

### Programming Skills
- Focus on the concepts
- Vim becomes second nature (not a barrier)
- Code and thought flow naturally

---

## Essential Vim Concepts for Learning

These are the Vim patterns you'll use repeatedly:

### Window Management
```vim
:vsplit " Open lesson | code side-by-side
C-w l " Move to right window
C-w h " Move to left window
C-w = " Equal width windows
C-w | " Full width for current
C-w 20 " Make window 20 columns wide
```

### Buffer Navigation
```vim
:bnext / :bn " Next buffer
:bprev / :bp " Previous buffer
C-^ " Toggle between last two buffers
:ls " List open buffers
:b1 " Go to buffer 1
```

### Marking Progress
```vim
ma " Mark position 'a'
`a " Jump to mark 'a'
:marks " View all marks
```

### Searching in Lessons
```vim
/pattern " Search forward
?pattern " Search backward
n " Next match
N " Previous match
* " Search word under cursor
```

### Recording & Replaying
```vim
qa " Start recording macro 'a'
" ... your commands ...
q " Stop recording
@a " Play macro 'a'
@@ or 2@a " Repeat macro
```

## How to Use This Guide

### If you're new to Vim:
1. Read **QUICK_START.md** (5 minutes)
2. Read **WORKFLOWS/split-screen-learning.md** (10 minutes)
3. Start learning Stage 1 Level 1 with the config provided
4. As you hit questions, check the **TIPS/** folder

### If you know Vim:
1. Review **CONFIG/init.vimrc-learning** to see optimizations
2. Check **TIPS/macro-recipes.md** for powerful automations
3. Jump into Stage 1 immediately
4. Customize the config to your preferences

### If you want Vim mastery + Programming:
1. Read **VIM-SPECIFIC-LESSONS/**
2. Follow **Path 2: Skills-First** above
3. Level up both skills simultaneously

---

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Learning a New Concept

```vim
" Lesson is open on left (read-only)
" Your code is on right

# Reading lesson about loops:
/Loop " Search for "Loop"
5j " Move down to see example
ma " Mark this spot for later

# Switch to right buffer
C-w l
# Start writing loop code

# Need to review? 
C-w h " Back to lesson
'a " Jump to marked concept
" ... review ...
C-w l " Back to code
```

### Example 2: Testing Your Code

```vim
# Code is written, want to compile

:terminal " Open terminal in new buffer
gcc solution.c -o solution && ./solution

# See output, has errors?
# Hit Enter to close terminal, fix code

# Test again?
up up enter " Recall previous command
```

### Example 3: Using Macros to Template

```vim
# You need to create 5 similar functions

qa " Record macro
i/* New function */
Enter
fn func_NAME() {
 
}
Escape
jq " Stop recording

" Now play it 5 times
@a @a @a @a @a " Or just 5@a

# Edit each template with your actual function names
```

## Common Questions

**Q: Will this slow me down compared to VS Code?** 
A: Initially yes. But after ~3 hours, you'll be significantly faster. After a week, you won't want to use anything else.

**Q: Do I need to already know Vim?** 
A: No! This guide teaches Vim naturally through programming. Start with QUICK_START.

**Q: Can I use VS Code instead?** 
A: Yes! See MODE_VSCODE/. But VIM MODE is optimized for Vim.

**Q: How do I compile/run?** 
A: Check [WORKFLOWS/testing-and-debugging.md](WORKFLOWS/testing-and-debugging.md). Built-in terminal support.

**Q: Can I save my progress?** 
A: Yes! Session management is covered in [WORKFLOWS/progress-tracking.md](WORKFLOWS/progress-tracking.md).

## Philosophy

> "The best editor is the one you already know. The best editor to learn is Vim—because you'll know it for your entire career."

This mode embraces that philosophy: **Learn programming and Vim together, once, properly.**
