# LEARN: Programming in 14 Languages

**490 hands-on lessons.** Fourteen languages. Five stages. Real projects.

Start coding in **5 minutes**.

## Quick Start

**Fastest way to your first lesson:**

```bash
learn
```

This launches an **interactive menu** where you can browse lessons, track progress, and start learning immediately.

### Or jump straight to a lesson

```bash
learn c++ 1                # Open C++ Stage 1, Level 1
learn rust 1               # Open Rust Stage 1, Level 1
learn python 1             # Open Python Stage 1, Level 1
```

### Choose your editor

```bash
learn c++ 1 --vim          # Neovim (default, split-screen)
learn c++ 1 --vscode       # VS Code
learn c++ 1 --terminal     # Terminal (read-only)
```

**Need to install?** Run: `bash CLI/install.sh`

## What You'll Learn

| Stage | What It Is | Time |
|-------|-----------|------|
| 1 | Copy working code, learn syntax | Week 1 |
| 2 | Turn pseudocode into real code | Week 2 |
| 3 | Design solutions to small problems | Week 3 |
| 4 | Build full projects from scratch | Weeks 4-5 |
| 5 | Create your own capstone project | Week 6 |

**14 languages supported:**

- Backend: C++, Rust, Python, Go, Lua
- Backend & Web: JavaScript, TypeScript, C#
- Systems & Scripting: Shell, PowerShell
- Mobile: Dart, Swift, Kotlin
- Databases: SQL

**7 lessons per stage** × **5 stages** = **35 lessons per language**

**Total: 490 lessons** across all 14 languages

## How to Navigate

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `learn` | **Interactive menu** (recommended!) |
| `learn c++ 1` | Open C++ Stage 1, Level 1 |
| `learn python 1` | Open Python Stage 1, Level 1 |
| `learn typescript 1` | Open TypeScript Stage 1, Level 1 |
| `learn --list` | See all 490 lessons |
| `learn --progress` | Check your progress with stats |
| `learn --next` | Continue where you left off |

### Jump Around

```bash
learn python 1           # Start Python
learn c++ 5 --stage 2    # Jump to Stage 2, Level 5
learn javascript 1       # Switch to JavaScript
learn go 3              # Try Go
```

## Three Ways to Use This

### I'm Learning to Code

1. Start: `learn` (interactive mode)
2. Select a language and lesson
3. Read the lesson and write code
4. Mark complete: `learn --complete <lang> 1 1`
5. Continue: `learn --next`
6. Track progress: `learn --progress`

### I'm Learning a New Language

1. Pick from 14 languages:
   - Backend: C++, Rust, Python, Go, Lua
   - Web: JavaScript, TypeScript, C#
   - Systems & Scripting: Shell, PowerShell, Dart
   - Mobile: Swift, Kotlin
   - Databases: SQL
2. Start: `learn python 1` (or use interactive mode)
3. Lessons get progressively harder (Stage 1 → Stage 5)
4. Complete at your own pace
5. Learn multiple languages simultaneously to spot patterns!

### I'm Teaching Others

All 490 lessons are organized by language:
`c-c++/`, `rust/`, `python/`, `javascript/`, `typescript/`, `go/`, `lua/`,
`dart/`, `swift/`, `kotlin/`, `sql/`, `csharp/`, `shell/`, `powershell/`

Each lesson includes:

- Clear learning objectives
- Step-by-step instructions
- Language-specific code examples
- Success checklists
- Additional explanations
- Progressive difficulty

Students can track their own progress with the built-in progress system!

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Command not found | Run: `bash CLI/install.sh` |
| Need help? | Run: `learn --help` |
| Using Vim? | Guide: [VIM_CHEATSHEET.md](VIM_CHEATSHEET.md) |

## Tips

- **Use interactive mode** (`learn`) for the best experience
- **Start with Python or C++** if you're new (most forgiving)
- **Try Rust or Go** for systems programming
- **JavaScript/TypeScript for web**, **Dart for mobile**
- **Shell for DevOps**, **SQL for databases**
- **Kotlin for Android**, **Swift for iOS**
- **Stuck?** Read the lesson materials carefully
- **Bored?** Jump to any language or stage
- **Track progress** with `learn --progress`
- **Learn multiple languages** to see programming patterns

## What's Next?

```bash
learn
```

Launch the interactive menu and start your learning journey!

Or jump straight in:

```bash
Or jump straight in:
```bash
learn c++ 1      # C++
learn python 1   # Python
learn typescript 1  # TypeScript
learn kotlin 1   # Kotlin
learn sql 1      # SQL
```

```

Everything you need is built into the CLI.
