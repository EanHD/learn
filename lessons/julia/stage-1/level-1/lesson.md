> ** LESSON NOTE:** This lesson file is **read-only** to prevent accidental edits. Your code goes in the **right window** (`main.jl` or similar). The lesson stays on the **left** for reference. Press `Ctrl+l` to switch to your code window, or `<Space>h` for help.

## Stage 1: Copying Code

### Today's Mission

Welcome to your first Julia program! Today, you'll create and run your very first program.

---

### Learning Goals

- Understand the basic structure of a Julia program
- Learn how to compile/run Julia code
- See your first program output 'Hello, World!'
- Get comfortable with your development environment

---

### Your Task

**Copy the following code EXACTLY as shown below into `main.jl`**

```
println("Hello, World!")
```

---

### How to Run

**Method 1 (Vim - Recommended):**
```
<Space>r
```

**Method 2 (Terminal):**
```
julia main.jl
```

**Expected output:**
```
Hello, World!
```

### Success Checklist

- [ ] Created a file named `main.jl`
- [ ] Copied the code exactly as shown
- [ ] Ran the program successfully
- [ ] Understood the basic concepts
- [ ] Experimented with small modifications

---

### What Just Happened?

You just created a real Julia program! Here's what makes it work:

- This is the basic structure all Julia programs follow
- The code you wrote is compiled/interpreted and executed
- The output appears in your terminal/console
- You can modify the message and run it again!

---

### Try This (Optional Challenges)

1. Modify the values and see what changes
2. Add your own variations to the code
3. Combine concepts from previous lessons
4. Break something on purpose, then fix it!

---

### Pro Tips

- Julia is fast like C, easy like Python
- Type annotations are optional
- Great for scientific computing
