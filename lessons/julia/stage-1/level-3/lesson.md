# Level 3: Basic Math Operations

> ** LESSON NOTE:** This lesson file is **read-only** to prevent accidental edits. Your code goes in the **right window** (`main.jl` or similar). The lesson stays on the **left** for reference. Press `Ctrl+l` to switch to your code window, or `<Space>h` for help.

## Stage 1: Copying Code

### Today's Mission

Master arithmetic operations and use Julia as your powerful calculator.

---

### Learning Goals

- Learn all basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %)
- Understand operator precedence (order of operations)
- Practice mathematical expressions
- Work with both integers and floating-point numbers

---

### Your Task

**Copy the following code EXACTLY as shown below into `main.jl`**

```
a = 10
b = 3

println("Addition: ", a + b)
println("Subtraction: ", a - b)
println("Multiplication: ", a * b)
println("Division: ", a / b)
println("Integer division: ", a ÷ b)
println("Modulus: ", a % b)
```

---

### How to Run

**Method 1 (Vim - Recommended):**
```
<Space>r
```

**Method 2 (Terminal):**
```
julia main.jl
```

**Expected output:**
```
Sum: 13
Difference: 7
Product: 30
Quotient: 3.33
```

### Success Checklist

- [ ] Created a file named `main.jl`
- [ ] Copied the code exactly as shown
- [ ] Ran the program successfully
- [ ] Understood the basic concepts
- [ ] Experimented with small modifications

---

### What Just Happened?

You just created a real Julia program! Here's what makes it work:

- Arithmetic operators work like a calculator
- Order of operations matters (PEMDAS)
- Integer division vs float division produces different results
- Modulus (%) gives the remainder after division

---

### Try This (Optional Challenges)

1. Modify the values and see what changes
2. Add your own variations to the code
3. Combine concepts from previous lessons
4. Break something on purpose, then fix it!

---

### Pro Tips

- Julia is fast like C, easy like Python
- Type annotations are optional
- Great for scientific computing

## ANSWER KEY (No peeking until you've tried!)

### Code Breakdown

The code you copied demonstrates fundamental Julia concepts:

**Key Components:**
- Syntax rules specific to Julia
- How data is stored and manipulated
- Input/output operations
- Program flow and structure

### Common Errors & Solutions

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Syntax error | Typo in code | Double-check spelling and punctuation |
| Runtime error | Code runs but crashes | Check your logic and data types |
| Unexpected output | Logic error | Review your algorithm step-by-step |

### Bonus Knowledge

- Julia has a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools
- Understanding these basics prepares you for advanced topics
- Practice is key - try writing similar programs from scratch
- Every expert programmer started exactly where you are now!

### Real-World Applications

This concept is used in:
1. Professional software development
2. Web applications and mobile apps
3. Data analysis and scientific computing
4. Automation and scripting
5. Game development
