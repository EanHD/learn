# Stage 4: Full Problem Solving

## Overview

You solve problems independently

### Level Overview

| Level | Topic | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Hello World - Basic program structure and output |
| 2 | Variables - Data storage and types |
| 3 | Basic Math - Arithmetic operations |
| 4 | User Input - Reading and processing input |
| 5 | Conditionals - Decision making with if/else |
| 6 | Loops - Repetition with loops |
| 7 | Functions - Code reuse and modularity |

### Learning Path

Each level introduces new concepts while reinforcing previous knowledge:

- **Levels 1-2**: Fundamentals (syntax, variables)
- **Levels 3-4**: Input/Output (math, user interaction)
- **Levels 5-6**: Control Flow (decisions, repetition)
- **Level 7**: Functions (advanced organization)

### Time Estimate

- Beginner: 1-2 weeks per stage
- Intermediate: 3-5 days per stage
- Advanced: 2-3 days per stage

## Getting Started

To work on these lessons:

```bash
learn
```

Then select **TypeScript** and choose your stage and level.

### File Locations

Your workspace files are stored in:
```
~/.local/share/learn/workspaces/typescript/stage-4/level-<N>/
```

---

## Tips for Success

1. **Read the lesson carefully** - Understand what you're learning
2. **Type the code** - In Stage 1, manual typing helps you learn syntax
3. **Run and test** - Make sure the output matches expectations
4. **Experiment** - Modify examples to see what happens
5. **Debug errors** - Read error messages and fix issues
6. **Move at your own pace** - No time limits!

## Moving Forward

Once you complete Stage 4:

- Review any lessons you found challenging
- Practice creating your own variations
- Look ahead to Stage 5
- Start thinking about what projects interest you
