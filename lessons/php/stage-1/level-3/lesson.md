# Level 3: Basic Math Operations

> ** LESSON NOTE:** This lesson file is **read-only** to prevent accidental edits. Your code goes in the **right window** (`main.php` or similar). The lesson stays on the **left** for reference. Press `Ctrl+l` to switch to your code window, or `<Space>h` for help.

## Stage 1: Copying Code

### Today's Mission

Master arithmetic operations and use PHP as your powerful calculator.

---

### Learning Goals

- Learn all basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %)
- Understand operator precedence (order of operations)
- Practice mathematical expressions
- Work with both integers and floating-point numbers

---

### Your Task

**Copy the following code EXACTLY as shown below into `main.php`**

```
<?php
$a = 10;
$b = 3;

echo "Addition: " . ($a + $b) . "\n";
echo "Subtraction: " . ($a - $b) . "\n";
echo "Multiplication: " . ($a * $b) . "\n";
echo "Division: " . ($a / $b) . "\n";
echo "Modulus: " . ($a % $b) . "\n";
echo "Float division: " . ($a / $b) . "\n";
?>
```

---

### How to Run

**Method 1 (Vim - Recommended):**
```
<Space>r
```

**Method 2 (Terminal):**
```
php main.php
```

**Expected output:**
```
Sum: 13
Difference: 7
Product: 30
Quotient: 3.33
```

### Success Checklist

- [ ] Created a file named `main.php`
- [ ] Copied the code exactly as shown
- [ ] Ran the program successfully
- [ ] Understood the basic concepts
- [ ] Experimented with small modifications

---

### What Just Happened?

You just created a real PHP program! Here's what makes it work:

- Arithmetic operators work like a calculator
- Order of operations matters (PEMDAS)
- Integer division vs float division produces different results
- Modulus (%) gives the remainder after division

---

### Try This (Optional Challenges)

1. Modify the values and see what changes
2. Add your own variations to the code
3. Combine concepts from previous lessons
4. Break something on purpose, then fix it!

---

### Pro Tips

- Variables start with $
- Use <?php to start PHP code
- Use . for string concatenation

---

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## ANSWER KEY (No cheating until you've tried!)

### Solution

```
<?php
$a = 10;
$b = 3;

echo "Addition: " . ($a + $b) . "\n";
echo "Subtraction: " . ($a - $b) . "\n";
echo "Multiplication: " . ($a * $b) . "\n";
echo "Division: " . ($a / $b) . "\n";
echo "Modulus: " . ($a % $b) . "\n";
echo "Float division: " . ($a / $b) . "\n";
?>
```

### Explanation
