# Level 3: Problem Analysis and Design

> ** LESSON NOTE:** This lesson file is **read-only** to prevent accidental edits. Your code goes in the **right window** (\`main.cpp\` or similar). The lesson stays on the **left** for reference. Press \`Ctrl+l\` to switch to your code window, or \`<Space>h\` for help.


## Stage 3: Problem to Pseudocode

### Today's Mission

Another level, another challenge! You're getting stronger at analyzing problems. This level focuses on performing calculations.

### Learning Goals

- Analyze a problem involving performing calculations
- Write clear pseudocode
- Understand the problem before coding
- Think before you type

### Your Task

Read the problem carefully:

```
[Problem statement will be specific to this level]
```

**Step 1:** Write pseudocode in `pseudocode.txt` that solves this problem

**Step 2:** Implement your pseudocode in Dart

Create `main.dart.dart` with your solution.


### How to Run

1. **Run the code**:
   ```
   dart hello.dart
   ```

**Expected output:**
```
Hello, World!
```

### Success Checklist

- [ ] Understand the problem completely
- [ ] Wrote clear, logical pseudocode
- [ ] Translated to working Dart code
- [ ] All requirements are met

### The Problem-Solving Process

1. **Read** - What are we trying to accomplish?
2. **Think** - What steps do we need?
3. **Design** - Write pseudocode
4. **Code** - Implement in Dart
5. **Test** - Does it work?

Each iteration of this cycle makes you a better programmer!

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Answer Key

### Complete Solution

```
void main() {
    print("Hello, World!");
}

```

### Code Breakdown

This solution demonstrates the key concepts from this lesson:

1. **Structure**: The program follows standard dart conventions with proper imports and main function
2. **Variables**: Data types are correctly declared and initialized
3. **Logic**: The program implements the required functionality
4. **Output**: Results are displayed clearly to the user
5. **Best Practices**: Code is readable and follows naming conventions

### Testing Your Solution

Try these test cases to verify your code works correctly:

1. **Basic Test**: Run the program with standard inputs
2. **Edge Cases**: Test with boundary values (0, -1, very large numbers)
3. **Error Handling**: Verify the program handles invalid inputs gracefully

### Tips for Understanding

- Review each section carefully
- Try modifying values to see how output changes
- Add your own printf/print statements to trace execution
- Experiment with different inputs
