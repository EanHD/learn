# Level 1: Problem to Pseudocode

## Stage 3: Problem to Pseudocode

### Today's Mission

You're now ready for Stage 3! This is where you start thinking like a real programmer. Instead of being given pseudocode, you'll read a problem description and write the pseudocode yourself. Then you'll implement it in Dart.

### Learning Goals

- Learn to read a problem and understand what's being asked
- Practice writing pseudocode from problem descriptions
- Understand the design phase of programming
- Build confidence in problem analysis

### Your Task

**Problem:** Write a program that greets the user with their name.

Step 1: Write the pseudocode first

```
What should happen:
1. Print "Hello, [name]"

Write your pseudocode in plain English below:
(Your pseudocode here)
```

Step 2: Implement your pseudocode in Dart

Create `main.dart.dart` with your solution.


### How to Run

1. **Run the code**:
   ```
   dart hello.dart
   ```

**Expected output:**
```
Hello, World!
```

### Success Checklist

- [ ] Wrote pseudocode that describes the solution
- [ ] Pseudocode is clear and logical
- [ ] Translated pseudocode to Dart code
- [ ] Program runs without errors
- [ ] Output matches expected result

### The Design Phase

Professional programmers spend time planning before coding:

1. **Understand** - Read the problem carefully
2. **Plan** - Write pseudocode to outline the solution
3. **Implement** - Write the actual code
4. **Test** - Make sure it works correctly

You're now learning this professional workflow!

### What This Teaches

- [ ] Not all problems come with detailed instructions
- [ ] You need to think about solutions before coding
- [ ] Design is as important as implementation
- [ ] Clear thinking leads to clear code

## Answer Key

### Complete Solution

```
void main() {
    print("Hello, World!");
}

```

### Code Breakdown

This solution demonstrates the key concepts from this lesson:

1. **Structure**: The program follows standard dart conventions with proper imports and main function
2. **Variables**: Data types are correctly declared and initialized
3. **Logic**: The program implements the required functionality
4. **Output**: Results are displayed clearly to the user
5. **Best Practices**: Code is readable and follows naming conventions

### Testing Your Solution

Try these test cases to verify your code works correctly:

1. **Basic Test**: Run the program with standard inputs
2. **Edge Cases**: Test with boundary values (0, -1, very large numbers)
3. **Error Handling**: Verify the program handles invalid inputs gracefully

### Tips for Understanding

- Review each section carefully
- Try modifying values to see how output changes
- Add your own printf/print statements to trace execution
- Experiment with different inputs
