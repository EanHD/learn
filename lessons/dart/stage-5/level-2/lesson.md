## Stage 5: Capstone Projects

### Today's Mission

Build your next capstone project with Dart! Each level in Stage 5 represents a different project complexity level, allowing you to progress at your own pace.

### Learning Goals

- Build a complete, functional Dart application
- Practice professional project development
- Create portfolio-worthy work
- Integrate all learned concepts

### Project Scope

This level requires:

- Complete feature implementation
- Proper error handling
- User-friendly interface
- Well-organized code
- Comprehensive testing

### Your Task

Design and implement a Dart project that demonstrates your mastery of the language.


### How to Run

1. **Run the code**:
   ```
   dart hello.dart
   ```

**Expected output:**
```
Hello, World!
```

### Project Suggestions

- Build something that interests you
- Solve a real problem
- Create something you'd use
- Make it complex enough to be interesting
- Keep it focused in scope

### Development Checklist

- [ ] Clear project goal defined
- [ ] Design and pseudocode complete
- [ ] Code is implemented and tested
- [ ] Error handling is robust
- [ ] Code is well-commented
- [ ] Documentation is clear
- [ ] Project works reliably

### Going Further

Once you complete this capstone:

1. Refactor for cleaner code
2. Add more features
3. Optimize performance
4. Document thoroughly
5. Share your work!

### Remember

Building real projects is the best way to learn. Each project teaches you something new about Dart and programming in general.

## Answer Key

### Complete Solution

```
void main() {
    print("Hello, World!");
}

```

### Code Breakdown

This solution demonstrates the key concepts from this lesson:

1. **Structure**: The program follows standard dart conventions with proper imports and main function
2. **Variables**: Data types are correctly declared and initialized
3. **Logic**: The program implements the required functionality
4. **Output**: Results are displayed clearly to the user
5. **Best Practices**: Code is readable and follows naming conventions

### Testing Your Solution

Try these test cases to verify your code works correctly:

1. **Basic Test**: Run the program with standard inputs
2. **Edge Cases**: Test with boundary values (0, -1, very large numbers)
3. **Error Handling**: Verify the program handles invalid inputs gracefully

### Tips for Understanding

- Review each section carefully
- Try modifying values to see how output changes
- Add your own printf/print statements to trace execution
- Experiment with different inputs
