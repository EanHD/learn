## Stage 4: Full Problem Solving

### Today's Mission

You're deepening your problem-solving skills! This level presents a challenge that tests your understanding of Dart.

### Learning Goals

- Apply multiple Dart concepts
- Solve problems without detailed guidance
- Write production-quality code
- Debug and test thoroughly

### Your Task

**Challenge:** [Problem-specific for this level]

Design and implement a complete Dart solution in `main.dart.dart`.


### How to Run

1. **Run the code**:
   ```
   dart hello.dart
   ```

**Expected output:**
```
Hello, World!
```

### Your Approach

1. Read and understand the complete problem
2. Design a solution (pseudocode on paper first!)
3. Implement in Dart
4. Test with multiple inputs
5. Review for code quality

### Success Checklist

- [ ] Program meets all requirements
- [ ] Handles edge cases
- [ ] Code is clean and commented
- [ ] No runtime errors
- [ ] Output is clear and useful

### Tips for Success

- [ ] Start simple, then add features
- [ ] Test often
- [ ] Use meaningful variable names
- [ ] Comment complex logic
- [ ] Don't be afraid to restart if needed

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Answer Key

### Complete Solution

```
void main() {
    print("Hello, World!");
}

```

### Code Breakdown

This solution demonstrates the key concepts from this lesson:

1. **Structure**: The program follows standard dart conventions with proper imports and main function
2. **Variables**: Data types are correctly declared and initialized
3. **Logic**: The program implements the required functionality
4. **Output**: Results are displayed clearly to the user
5. **Best Practices**: Code is readable and follows naming conventions

### Testing Your Solution

Try these test cases to verify your code works correctly:

1. **Basic Test**: Run the program with standard inputs
2. **Edge Cases**: Test with boundary values (0, -1, very large numbers)
3. **Error Handling**: Verify the program handles invalid inputs gracefully

### Tips for Understanding

- Review each section carefully
- Try modifying values to see how output changes
- Add your own printf/print statements to trace execution
- Experiment with different inputs
