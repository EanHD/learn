## Stage 1: Copying Code

### Today's Mission

Welcome to Swift! Today, you'll create your first Swift program. Swift is Apple's modern programming language used for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS development.

### Learning Goals

- Understand Swift program structure
- Learn how to run Swift code
- Create your first output
- Get comfortable with Swift syntax

### Your Task

Copy the following code EXACTLY as shown into a new file called `hello.swift`:

```
print("Hello, World!")
```

### How to Execute

```
swift hello.swift
```

Expected output:

```
Hello, World!
```

### Success Checklist

- [ ] Created a file named `hello.swift`
- [ ] Copied the code exactly as shown
- [ ] Program executed without errors
- [ ] Saw "Hello, World!" printed

---

**Swift is safe, fast, and expressive. It's the language of Apple platforms!**

## Answer Key

### Complete Solution

```
print("Hello, World!")

```

### Code Breakdown

This solution demonstrates the key concepts from this lesson:

1. **Structure**: The program follows standard swift conventions with proper imports and main function
2. **Variables**: Data types are correctly declared and initialized
3. **Logic**: The program implements the required functionality
4. **Output**: Results are displayed clearly to the user
5. **Best Practices**: Code is readable and follows naming conventions

### Testing Your Solution

Try these test cases to verify your code works correctly:

1. **Basic Test**: Run the program with standard inputs
2. **Edge Cases**: Test with boundary values (0, -1, very large numbers)
3. **Error Handling**: Verify the program handles invalid inputs gracefully

### Tips for Understanding

- Review each section carefully
- Try modifying values to see how output changes
- Add your own printf/print statements to trace execution
- Experiment with different inputs
