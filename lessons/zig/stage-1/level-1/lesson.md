# Level 1: Hello World

> ** LESSON NOTE:** This lesson file is **read-only** to prevent accidental edits. Your code goes in the **right window** (`main.zig` or similar). The lesson stays on the **left** for reference. Press `Ctrl+l` to switch to your code window, or `<Space>h` for help.

## Stage 1: Copying Code

### Today's Mission

Welcome to your first Zig program! Today, you'll create and run your very first program.

---

### Learning Goals

- Understand the basic structure of a Zig program
- Learn how to compile/run Zig code
- See your first program output 'Hello, World!'
- Get comfortable with your development environment

---

### Your Task

**Copy the following code EXACTLY as shown below into `main.zig`**

```
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
    const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();
    try stdout.print("Hello, World!\n", .{});
}
```

---

### How to Run

**Method 1 (Vim - Recommended):**
```
<Space>r
```

**Method 2 (Terminal):**
```
zig build-exe main.zig
./main
```

**Expected output:**
```
Hello, World!
```

### Success Checklist

- [ ] Created a file named `main.zig`
- [ ] Copied the code exactly as shown
- [ ] Compiled without errors
- [ ] Ran the program successfully
- [ ] Understood the basic concepts
- [ ] Experimented with small modifications

---

### What Just Happened?

You just created a real Zig program! Here's what makes it work:

- This is the basic structure all Zig programs follow
- The code you wrote is compiled/interpreted and executed
- The output appears in your terminal/console
- You can modify the message and run it again!

---

### Try This (Optional Challenges)

1. Modify the values and see what changes
2. Add your own variations to the code
3. Combine concepts from previous lessons
4. Break something on purpose, then fix it!

---

### Pro Tips

- Zig has no hidden control flow
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Compile-time code execution

## ANSWER KEY (No cheating until you've tried!)

### Solution

```
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {

    try stdout.print("Hello, World!\n", .{});
}
```

### Explanation

This solution demonstrates the key concepts from this lesson. Copy this code exactly as shown, and make sure you understand each part before moving on.

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Code runs without errors
- [ ] Output matches expected result
- [ ] You understand what each line does
