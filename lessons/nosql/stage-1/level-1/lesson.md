## Stage 1: Copying Code

### Today's Mission

Welcome to your first MongoDB (NoSQL) program! Today, you'll create and run your very first program.

---

### Learning Goals

- Understand the basic structure of a MongoDB (NoSQL) program
- Learn how to compile/run MongoDB (NoSQL) code
- See your first program output 'Hello, World!'
- Get comfortable with your development environment

---

### Your Task

**Copy the following code EXACTLY as shown below into `main.js`**

```
// MongoDB JavaScript shell script
print("Hello, World!");
```

---

### How to Run

**Method 1 (Vim - Recommended):**
```
<Space>r
```

**Method 2 (Terminal):**
```
mongo < script.js
```

**Expected output:**
```
Hello, World!
```

### What Just Happened?

You just created a real MongoDB (NoSQL) program! Here's what makes it work:

- This is the basic structure all MongoDB (NoSQL) programs follow
- The code you wrote is compiled/interpreted and executed
- The output appears in your terminal/console
- You can modify the message and run it again!

---

### Try This (Optional Challenges)

1. Modify the values and see what changes
2. Add your own variations to the code
3. Combine concepts from previous lessons
4. Break something on purpose, then fix it!

---

### Pro Tips

- MongoDB stores data as documents
- JavaScript shell for queries
- NoSQL = flexible schema
