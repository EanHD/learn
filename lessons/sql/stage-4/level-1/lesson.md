## Stage 4: Full Problem Solving

### Today's Mission

You've reached Stage 4! This is where you solve complete problems independently. You'll read a problem, design a solution, write pseudocode, and implement it in Sql - all on your own.

### Learning Goals

- Develop independent problem-solving skills
- Apply all previous knowledge to new problems
- Write clean, working code without guidance
- Become a confident programmer

### Your Task

**Problem:** Create a program that demonstrates your understanding of Sql.

Requirements:
- Use variables to store data
- Process the data in some meaningful way
- Display results clearly
- Include comments explaining your code


### How to Run

1. **Run the code**:
   ```
   sqlite3 < hello.sql
   ```

**Expected output:**
```
Hello, World!
```

### How to Approach This

1. **Understand** - What are all the requirements?
2. **Design** - Sketch out your solution
3. **Code** - Write Sql code that meets all requirements
4. **Test** - Make sure it works correctly
5. **Review** - Is your code clean and well-commented?

### Success Checklist

- [ ] Program runs without errors
- [ ] All requirements are met
- [ ] Code is readable with good variable names
- [ ] Includes helpful comments
- [ ] Output is clear and useful

### What Makes Stage 4 Different

**Stages 1-3:** Guided learning with clear instructions
**Stage 4:** You're now the designer

This is professional programming. In the real world, you'll be given problems and expected to solve them. You now have the skills to do that!

### Confidence Building

If you reach this point and can solve Stage 4 problems, you have real programming skills. Celebrate that! Many beginners never reach this level.
