## Stage 3: Problem to Pseudocode

### Today's Mission

Time to think like a programmer! You'll analyze real problems and design solutions using pseudocode before writing any code. This is the most important skill in programming.

**The Process:**
1. Read and understand the problem requirements
2. Break the problem into smaller sub-problems
3. Design an algorithm in pseudocode
4. Identify edge cases and constraints
5. Implement the solution in SQL

---

### Learning Goals

- Develop problem analysis skills
- Learn to design algorithms before coding
- Practice breaking complex problems into steps
- Master pseudocode notation and planning
- Understand edge cases and constraints

---

### Your Task

**Problem Statement:**

Data Structure Planning - Design an algorithm to solve this problem, then implement it.

**Your Process:**
1. **Understand**: Read the problem 3 times
2. **Plan**: Write pseudocode outlining your approach
3. **Code**: Implement your design in SQL
4. **Test**: Verify with multiple test cases
5. **Refine**: Optimize and improve

**Deliverables:**
- Written pseudocode (comments in your code)
- Working SQL implementation
- Test cases showing it works

### How to Run

1. **Run the code**:
   ```
   sqlite3 < hello.sql
   ```

**Expected output:**
```
Hello, World!
```

### How to Approach This

**Step 1: Understand**
- Read all requirements carefully
- Identify inputs, outputs, and constraints
- Ask yourself: "What is the core problem?"

**Step 2: Plan**
- Sketch out your approach on paper
- List the steps needed
- Identify potential challenges

**Step 3: Implement**
- Start with a basic version
- Add features incrementally
- Test after each addition

**Step 4: Test**
- Try normal cases
- Try edge cases (empty, max, min)
- Try invalid inputs
- Verify all requirements met

**Step 5: Refine**
- Review your code
- Add comments
- Optimize if needed
- Ensure it's readable

### Key Concepts

**Problem Decomposition:**
- Break big problems into smaller ones
- Solve each part individually
- Combine solutions together
- Always start simple, then expand

**Algorithm Design:**
- Clear input/output definition
- Step-by-step logic
- Consider edge cases
- Plan before coding

### Try This (Optional Challenges)

1. Extend the solution with additional features
2. Handle more edge cases
3. Optimize for performance
4. Add a user interface
5. Write unit tests

---

### Helpful Resources

- Review previous lessons for syntax help
- Check WORKSPACE_INSTRUCTIONS.md for setup
- Use `<Space>h` in Vim for keyboard shortcuts
- Test frequently to catch errors early

## ANSWER KEY (Study after attempting!)

### Solution Approach

**Problem-Solving Framework:**

1. **Input Analysis**: What data do we receive?
2. **Output Requirements**: What should we produce?
3. **Process Design**: How do we transform input to output?
4. **Edge Cases**: What could go wrong?

**Pseudocode Template:**
```
ALGORITHM: [Name]
INPUT: [What we need]
OUTPUT: [What we produce]

BEGIN
    1. Initialize variables
    2. Get input from user
    3. Process the data
        - Step 1
        - Step 2
        - Step 3
    4. Display results
END
```

Then translate this directly to SQL code.

### Common Errors & Solutions

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Logic error | Algorithm design flaw | Review pseudocode, trace by hand |
| Syntax error | Language rules violated | Check language documentation |
| Runtime error | Invalid operation | Add validation, handle edge cases |
| Wrong output | Misunderstanding requirements | Re-read problem carefully |

### Next Steps

1. Review your solution critically
2. Compare with best practices
3. Optimize if needed
4. Move to next level when ready
5. Keep practicing!
