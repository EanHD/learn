### How to Run

1. **Run the code**:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 < hello.sql
   ```

**Expected output:**
```
Hello, World!
```

### How to Approach This

**Step 1: Understand**
- Read all requirements carefully
- Identify inputs, outputs, and constraints
- Ask yourself: "What is the core problem?"

**Step 2: Plan**
- Sketch out your approach on paper
- List the steps needed
- Identify potential challenges

**Step 3: Implement**
- Start with a basic version
- Add features incrementally
- Test after each addition

**Step 4: Test**
- Try normal cases
- Try edge cases (empty, max, min)
- Try invalid inputs
- Verify all requirements met

**Step 5: Refine**
- Review your code
- Add comments
- Optimize if needed
- Ensure it's readable

## ANSWER KEY (Study after attempting!)

### Solution Approach

**Production-Grade Development:**

Professional applications require:

**1. Architecture**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Modular, testable components
- Scalable design patterns

**2. Error Handling**
- Validate all inputs
- Try-catch for exceptions
- Meaningful error messages
- Graceful degradation

**3. Documentation**
- Clear function/class comments
- Usage examples
- README file
- Inline explanations

**4. Testing**
- Unit tests for components
- Integration tests
- Edge case coverage
- Performance benchmarks

Remember: Good code is code that others (including future you) can understand and maintain.

### Common Errors & Solutions

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Logic error | Algorithm design flaw | Review pseudocode, trace by hand |
| Syntax error | Language rules violated | Check language documentation |
| Runtime error | Invalid operation | Add validation, handle edge cases |
| Wrong output | Misunderstanding requirements | Re-read problem carefully |

### Next Steps

1. Review your solution critically
2. Compare with best practices
3. Optimize if needed
4. Move to next level when ready
5. Keep practicing!
